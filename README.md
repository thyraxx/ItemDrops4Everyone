## Risk of Rain 2 mod
# ItemDrops4Everyone

Unfortunately it looked like ShareSuite didn't do exactly what I wanted.
The share function in the mod doesn't provide each player to choose their own item as far as I know, or I just haven't found it yet, everyone gets only the item that the person gets.
But you still want to have your own build, that's why I made this, an item is dropped at everyones location when someone opens a chest, shrine or equipment (although that one might be removed).



This mod hasn't been released on the Thunderstore yet for multiple reasons, one is I still need to ask/find out if this functionality isn't actually in ShareSuite and secondly so no duplicate mods are being released (as of rule by the ThunderStore, the mod will be marked as deprecated), and secondly, there was a weird bug that occurred when a player died, at that point only the host would get items, although it seemed it worked fine with 2 players, this bug was observer when I was playing with 3 players so more testing is needed.
